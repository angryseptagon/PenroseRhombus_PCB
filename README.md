PCBs to make penrose tilings with addressable LEDs. in order to make a continous data signal, the data follows marking shown on PCB. these markings form closed loops, however loops can be merged using the switch onboard

I just realized that it may be possible to use the same circuit to make ammann-beenker tilings. I may end up making those tiles and putting them here or make a fork, idk. honestly I am just doing this to distract myself.
